# Create Project & Components

Welcome to the first installment of the Ravenous project! Over the next couple of weeks, you’ll build a website called “Ravenous”, a Yelp-like clone.

In total, there will be four parts to this project:

- Creating Static Components
- Passing Information to Components
- Setting the State of Ravenous Components
- Interacting with the Yelp API

Today, you will start by building the first part of Ravenous: Creating Static Components.

Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter
The four projects will test your knowledge of JavaScript and React, all with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restuarants in your area.
