### Fetch Polyfill Usage for Old Browsers

fetch() is a browser API, older browsers may not support it. To increase the accessibility of Ravenous to a wider audience of users, weâ€™ll need to add a fetch() polyfill to support older browsers. 

run `npm install whatwg-fetch --save` to install the whatwg-fetch polyfill and add it to your package.json file.


### How to solve CORS policy problem?

fetch() don't function correctly due to CORS restrictions. [cors-anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/)

We can bypass this restriction with an API called CORS Anywhere. CORS Anywhere will take requests sent to its API endpoint, make them for the requesting app with the proper CORS permissions, and then return the response back to the requesting app.

Prepend the URL path passed to the first argument in fetch() with the following:

`https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`


### Yelp Authorization header

When we make requests to the Yelp API, we have to present a form of identification for the browser. This is because the Yelp API wants to know that we are authorized to access the API.

This identification is presented using our API key as a browser header.
